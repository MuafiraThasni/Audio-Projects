# Audio-Projects
This repo contains the consolidated notebooks of Audio data related projects.
  1. [Voice Activity Detection](https://github.com/MuafiraThasni/Audio-Projects/blob/main/Voice%20Activity%20Detection.ipynb)
  - Objective: Detect speech regions in audio recordings and segment them.
  - Approach: Applied signal processing techniques (spectral analysis, energy thresholds) to identify speech vs. non-speech.
  - Features: Plotted speech segments, extracted frequency distributions, and visualized differences across words.
  - Outcome: Successfully segmented speech portions, enabling clean speech extraction for further analysis.
2. [Audio Classification](https://github.com/MuafiraThasni/Audio-Projects/blob/main/Audio%20Classification.ipynb)
  - Objective: Classify spoken words from audio recordings using deep learning.
  - Approach: Converted audio signals into spectrograms and trained a CNN-based model.
  - Features: Used Mel Spectrograms, Log-Mel features, and data augmentation techniques.
  - Outcome: Achieved high accuracy in recognizing spoken words from a limited vocabulary.
3. [Speaker Recognition](https://github.com/MuafiraThasni/Audio-Projects/blob/main/Speaker_Recognition.ipynb)
- Speaker Recognition using Frequency-Domain Speech Features
- Objective: developing a deep learning model for speaker classification using frequency-domain features extracted from speech samples
- Approach: Used feature extraction techniques like MFCCs and embeddings with deep learning models.
- Features: Implemented speaker embedding models (e.g., x-vectors, i-vectors) and clustering techniques for diarization.
- Outcome: Successfully identified and separated different speakers, enhancing applications like multi-speaker transcription
